WBLOCK SCRIPT FORMAT TESTING
============================

COMMAND LINE FORMAT (Working in Method 4):
(command "._-WBLOCK" dwg_path "=" block_name)

This sends 4 inputs:
1. "._-WBLOCK" - Command with dot prefix (current namespace) and underscore (international)
2. dwg_path - File path response
3. "=" - Block mode indicator
4. block_name - Block name

SCRIPT FILE FORMAT ATTEMPTS:
============================

FORMAT 1 (Combined =blockname):
-WBLOCK
C:\path\file.dwg
=BLOCKNAME

RESULT: "bad order function: COMMAND" error
REASON: Script parser sees "=BLOCKNAME" as invalid command syntax

FORMAT 2 (Separated = and blockname):
-WBLOCK
C:\path\file.dwg
=
BLOCKNAME

RESULT: Should work - matches command input sequence
Each line = one command response

FORMAT 3 (With underscore prefix):
_-WBLOCK
C:\path\file.dwg
=
BLOCKNAME

RESULT: May fail - underscore not valid in .scr files (only in LISP commands)

FORMAT 4 (With blank line at end):
-WBLOCK
C:\path\file.dwg
=
BLOCKNAME
<blank>

RESULT: Blank line accepts any remaining prompts


CORRECT FORMAT FOR .SCR FILES:
================================

-WBLOCK
C:\path\file.dwg
=
BLOCKNAME
<blank line>

Key Points:
1. NO underscore prefix in .scr files
2. = and blockname on SEPARATE lines
3. Blank line at end to accept defaults
4. Each line = one response to a prompt
